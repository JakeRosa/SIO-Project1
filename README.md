## Project description

The DETI memorabilia is a web service that allows the common user to view various products offered by DETI, as well as their own merchandise and more specialized materials for everyday university life without the need to log in. The user can also add products to the shopping cart and, if logged in, proceed to checkout. If they only want to save products for a future purchase, they can always add them to their wish list. A logged-in user can also view their profile, edit their personal information, and see their purchase history. The administrator can edit products, including stock updates when necessary.

## Running the project

To run both applications simultaneously, simply execute the following command in the project's root folder:

```bash
docker-compose up --build # --build only if it's the first time you're running the command
```

To run only one of the applications, just run the same command with a slight adjustment:

```bash
docker-compose up --build (api_unsec | api_sec) # --build only if it's the first time you're running the command
```

Please note that `(api_unsec | api_sec)` is a placeholder for the specific application you want to run, and you should replace it with the actual name of the application you want to start (e.g., "api_unsec" or "api_sec").
